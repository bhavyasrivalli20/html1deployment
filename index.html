<h2>
<li>To develop any application or software with high quality everyone must follow some rules & Guidelines.</li>
<li>These rules are explained under SDLC Methodologies.</li>
<h3> <li>To understand more about the SDLC Model, first we have to know about version control system (vcs)</li> </h3>
</h2>
<h1 align="center"><b><U><font color="green">VCS(Version control system):-</font></u></b></h1>
<h2><i>It is the practice of tracking & Managing changes to software code. version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code which helps to fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. VCS is also called as source control system. </i></h2>

 <h1><u><font color="purple">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</font></u></h1>
<h2><i>Definition</i></h2>
<h3>SDLC is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software that meets customer expectations.</h3>

<h2><i>Objectives</i></h2>
<h3>1. Produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations.<br>
2. Ensure a structured and disciplined approach to software development.</h3>

<h2><i>Characteristics</i></h2>
<h3>1. SDLC is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.<br>
2. It's a structured process used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.</h3>

<h2><i>Importance</i></h2>
<h3>1. Without SDLC, software development would not be systematic or disciplined.<br>
2. SDLC ensures clear understanding among team members about what to do and when to do it.<br>
3. It helps managers monitor project progress effectively.</h3>

<h2><i><font color="blue">SDLC Models</font></i></h2>
<li><h3>There are several SDLC models, including:</h3></li>
<h3><ol>
 <li>Waterfall Model</li>
 <li>Agile Model</li>
 <li>Spiral Model</li>
 <li>Incremental Model</li></h3>
</ol>
</li>
<h2><i><font color="blue">SDLC Phases</font></i></h2>
<h3> <li>The SDLC framework includes the following phases:</li></h3>

<h3>1. Planning<br>
2. Requirements Gathering<br>
3. Design<br>
4. Implementation<br>
5. Testing<br>
6. Deployment<br>
7. Maintenance</h3>

<h1><font color="blue">Waterfall Model</font></h1>
<h2>The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential project management approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next, similar to how water flows down a waterfall; it's considered a structured method with distinct stages like requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment, where each phase builds upon the previous one without backtracking, making it ideal for projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal flexibility.</h2>
<h1><font color="blue">Agile Model</font></h1>
<h2>Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement by breaking projects into smaller, iterative phases called "sprints," allowing teams to quickly adapt to changing needs and deliver working software in increments, prioritizing customer feedback throughout the development process.</h2>

<h1> <font color="blue">What is kanban?</font></h1>
<h2>Kanban is a popular framework used to implement Agile and DevOps software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.</h2>
<h1><font color="blue">What is Scrum?</font></h1>
<h2>Scrum is a popular Agile framework used for managing and completing complex projects. It emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward well-defined goals.</h2>.
<h1>Key Components</h1>
<h2>1. Product Owner: Responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog.<br>
2. Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures the team follows Scrum principles.<br>
3. Development Team: A cross-functional team of developers, testers, and designers who work together to develop the product.<br>
4. Sprint: A time-boxed iteration (usually 2-4 weeks) where the team works on a specific set of tasks from the product backlog.<br>
5. Daily Scrum: A 15-minute meeting where team members share their progress, plans, and any obstacles.<br>
</h2>
<h1><font color="blue">DevOps</font></h1>
<h2>
<li> DevOps is a combination of development (dev) and operations (ops)</li>

<li>DevOps is a methodology, by using this Integrate The developers  and operations team using Automation  process.</li>

<li>It is a software development process which aims to Integrate the work flow of development teams and operation teams.</li>

<li>DevOps means, people working together to create build, deliver slw quickly and securely. It's all about making the process faster and better by using an automation.</li>

<li>DevOpe works based on Agile approch.</li>

 <h1>Software Development team (Dev):</h1>

<h2>This is where the developers write code to create amazing applications.</h2>

<h1>Operations (ops):</h1>

<h2>These employees are like the protectors of the digital world. they take care of testing, deploying, managing, and keeping application running smoothly in the real world.</h2>
